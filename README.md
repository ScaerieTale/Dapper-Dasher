# Dapper Dasher!
## A short, 2D auto-runner in C++

This project is part of the C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming for Beginners course, and as such I consider my code here 100% CC 0 open source.

The textures however, are property of gamedev.tv and/or the original artist(s).  I have no redistribution rights, and if asked, will immediately remove them from my github.

I plan to replace these files with either open source art or art of my own creation soon™, but as of writing this readme file, the code is still just a blue rectangle that can jump, so... :P
